       <h2> Patrick Mahomes had a historic first 2 seasons as a starter!</h2>
       <p> In his first season as a starter he became the second QB ever to throw for over 5,000 yards and 50+ touchdown passes. He was also named the NFL MVP, Offensive Player of the Year (OPOY), first team All-Pro, selected to the Pro-Bowl, and lead the KC Chiefs to the AFC Championship game, all of that just coming in his first season! In his second season he was forced to sit out multiple games because of a dislocated knee cap, but came back and was named to the Pro-Bowl, won SuperBowl LIV, and recieved the SuperBowl MVP, making him the youngest player to ever earn both the SuperBowl MVP and the regular season MVP.
